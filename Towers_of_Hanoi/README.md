[Towers of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) is a classic puzzle where the user must move the tower from the starting position to a new position.
The tower and it's pieces may only be placed upon the three pegs within the puzzle.
Each of the pieces may only be place on an empty peg or on top of a piece which is larger than itself.
The player may only move one piece at a time and the goal is to generally move the entire tower on to a new peg in the fewest number of moves.

The game was created with goal of implementing the rules and allowing for the number of pieces to be easily changed along with the program running on a mobile device.
Currently it all works fine however in the future a move counter, reset button, and a way of the game to detect when you have successfully completed the puzzle would make great additions.
