This was a project created by following [The Coding Train's series on Quadtrees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJxEcs0w_kE).
There will be a number of points placed within the window using random guassian distribution.
Then a quad tree is generated such that no more than four points are within any suqare of the tree.
Then the quadtree is drawn.
Finally a random rectangle within the window is constructed and drawn in green.
It will also find all of the points within the rectangle and draw those in green.
